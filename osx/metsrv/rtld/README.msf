This is the runtime linker for the posix meterpreter. It is currently linux/x86
only, but this will probably change later on once I have meterpreter working 
in general.

Currently, make test will build a stand alone binary that will unpack/resolve
libc, libm, libcrypto, libssl, and the metsrv_main binary. It will then call
the server_setup(fd) code. 

make will build a .so with the above code. It will probably be used for payload
support, but that is a little while away.
